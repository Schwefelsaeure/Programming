# 5 Projects That Get You Hired

## Ideas

1. Consume one 3rd-party API and show the data on the website (note: backend is already there).
2. A brochure site to show a good frontend (e.g., a landing page for a restaurant with the location and the menu).
3. Create a very simple e-commerce site where you can select and buy items (on the backend site without any authentication).
4. Build your own portfolio website to showcase your projects.
5. A small and simple game with pre-defined rules (e.g. chess or checkers with websockets and real-time communication).
